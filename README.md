# Hi there! 👋

I'm a **Software Engineering** student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence** and also studying **Logistics**. I'm passionate about building robust, well-architected applications with clean code and best practices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Interests

### Frontend Development
I enjoy crafting vanilla front-end applications using modern tooling:
- **TypeScript** for type-safe code
- **HTML & CSS** for semantic and responsive designs
- **Vitest** for fast and reliable unit testing
- **Husky, ESLint, Prettier** for code quality and consistency

### Backend Development
I'm passionate about backend development with:
- **Spring Boot** applications
- Building scalable and maintainable services

## 💡 Development Philosophy

I believe in writing code that is:
- **Clean Architecture** – organized, modular, and scalable
- **Pragmatic** – solving real problems efficiently
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** – writing tests first for reliable code
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** – focusing on user behavior and outcomes
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** – aligning code with business domains

## 🎯 What I'm Working On

- Deepening my knowledge in **Artificial Intelligence**
- Building full-stack applications with **Spring Boot** and **TypeScript**
- Developing versatile solutions that adapt to any domain-specific requirements
- Exploring best practices in software architecture and design patterns

## 🚀 My Approach

I focus on building **flexible, modular applications** that can be tailored to meet any specific business needs. Whether it's e-commerce, logistics, healthcare, or any other domain, I believe in creating adaptable solutions that solve real-world problems across industries.
